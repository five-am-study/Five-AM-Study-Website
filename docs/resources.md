## Tools

### Spaced Repetition

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - I highly recommend using anki it's not only a powerful flashcard app.   
**It's an automated spaced repetition scheduling system - a powerhouse.**  
I learnt Japanese via it and passed the highest level certificate for foreigners (JLPT N1).    
IT professionals are sleeping on this tool.
